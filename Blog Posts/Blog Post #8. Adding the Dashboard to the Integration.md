## Adding the Dashboard to the Integration

The last part of our integration is including the dashboard that has been created for this project. This will require us to export the
dashboard from Kibana using the `elastic-package export` capability along with a build and deploy. This should be a pretty easy endeavor.

Let us get into it!

#### 1. Import Kibana Dashboard

We will start by importing the dashboard called `Feed Analysis - Integration.ndjson` found [here]() into Kibana.

I have detailed this process in Blog Post #1 in the [Import Kibana Dashboard Section](https://github.com/nicpenning/Elasti-daddy/blob/main/Blog%20Posts/Blog%20Post%20%231.%20Data%20Ingest.md#12-import-kibana-dashboard). The same steps still apply here.

Once the dashboard is imported, move on to the next step to export it.
