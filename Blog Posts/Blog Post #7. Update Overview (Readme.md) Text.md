## Update Overview (README.md) Text

The main page of the Elasti-daddy Integration is still using the sample text that we want to update and make more accurate. This blog post outlines
the process to get that updated to something more usable.

This is what the Integration looks like now:

Let us dive right in and get this cleaned up!

#### 1. Update the README
<details>

We will start off by locating the README.md file that is in the `elasti_daddy/docs/` directory and taking a peek inside.

```bash
napsta@el33t-b00k-1:~/GitHub/Elasti-daddy/Integration/elasti_daddy$ cd docs
napsta@el33t-b00k-1:~/GitHub/Elasti-daddy/Integration/elasti_daddy/docs$ ls
README.md
napsta@el33t-b00k-1:~/GitHub/Elasti-daddy/Integration/elasti_daddy/docs$ nano README.md

<!-- If applicable -->

## Requirements
...snipped for brevity...
```

Keep in mind that the documentation uses markdown language. You can follow the documentation on how to use markdown [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/).

The current README.md that exists was automatically genereated when we created the integration. We will create some new files and directories to generate
a new README.md file.
