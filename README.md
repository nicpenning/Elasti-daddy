# Elasti-dad üë®‚Äçüçº
This is a project for preparing and analyzing motherhood and fatherhood data for taking care of a baby. The aim is to learn how Elastic Integrations are developed and deployed but more importantly, what questions can we answer with the data collected when it comes to the care and feeding of a baby. Sample data includes breastfeeding, bottle feeding (milk or formula), milk extraction, etc..
