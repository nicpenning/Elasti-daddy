```
Behold, children are a heritage from the LORD,
the fruit of the womb a reward.

Like arrows in the hand of a warrior
are the children of one’s youth.

Blessed is the man
who fills his quiver with them!

He shall not be put to shame
when he speaks with his enemies in the gate.

                              -Psalm 127:3–5
```
🙏 May God's blessings be to those fathers and mothers out there in the world raising their families.  

In honor of Father's day (and of course Mother's day), I will be developing this project to analyze trends with a small set of data over 4-12 weeks of data points for raising a newborn baby. 

⚠️ Disclaimer: I am not suggesting that any one use this project to raise a child but rather a way to learn about Elastic integrations.

This is a project for preparing and analyzing motherhood and fatherhood data for taking care of a baby. The aim is to learn how Elastic Integrations are developed and deployed. Sample data includes breastfeeding, bottle feeding (milk or formula), milk extraction, etc..

I am excited to turn my hand written notes into useful visualizations to see what I can learn along the way and share that experience for all.
