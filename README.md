🙏 May God's blessings be to those fathers and mothers out there in the world raising their families.  

In honor of Father's day (and of course Mother's day), I will be developing this project to analyze trends with a small set of data over 4-12 weeks of data points for raising a newborn baby. 

⚠️ Disclaimer: I am not suggesting that any one use this project to raise a child but rather a way to learn about Elatic integrations.

This is a project for preparing and analyzing motherhood and fatherhood data for taking care of a baby. The aim is to learn how Elastic Integrations are developed and deployed. Sample data includes breastfeeding, bottle feeding (milk or formula), milk extraction, etc..

I am excited to turn my hand written notes into useful visualizations to see what I can learn along the way and share that experience for all.
